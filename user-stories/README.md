# User Stories

The `user-stories.md` file outlines key user stories that capture the main interactions users have with the Airbnb Clone system. These stories are derived from the systemâ€™s use case diagram and reflect the essential goals and tasks of each actor: Guest, Host, Admin, and Third-Party Services.

Each story is structured to describe:
- Who the user is
- What they want to do
- Why it matters (their goal)

This approach ensures the system is designed with real-world usage in mind and provides a clear foundation for backend development, sprint planning, and feature validation.
