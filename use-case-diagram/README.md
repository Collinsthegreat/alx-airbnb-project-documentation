# Use Case Diagram

The use case diagram illustrates the key interactions between system users (Guests, Hosts, Admins, and external services) and the core functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend.

It highlights major user actions such as registration, booking, property management, payments, and system monitoring. Each actor is mapped to the relevant features they can access, providing a clear, high-level view of the system's functional scope.

This diagram serves as a foundational reference for developers, designers, and project stakeholders to understand the system's behavior and user flows.
